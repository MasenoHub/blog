+++

Maseno University started in **October 1990** as a constituent college of Moi University and became a full-fledged university 11 years later in 2001. The curent location of the Main Campus was orginally the site of the Siriba Teachers' College, and a significant number of the buildings constructed at that point in history are still standing to show for it.

Present-day Maseno University is among the national leaders in technology, borrowing from Kisumu county which is taking large strides in the same. Aside from the brilliant innovation that is the Maseno eCampus, first of its kind in the country and the region at large, the institution has some of the best programmes in computing and informatics.

### The Maseno Hub

The Maseno Hub was originally set up to nurture interest and skill in computing and related technologies not only within the university, but also in the greater Maseno area. We are geared towards innovation,peer-learning and creativity, and our main aim is to create a space where these values may be encouraged among individuals, be they students or not. Secondary to that, The Maseno Hub also aims to equip its members with the skills and knowledge necessary for the ever-changing niche in the employment and startup markets.  

#### Who Are We? 

The Maseno Hub is a non-discriminational society whose purpose is to bring like-minded individuals together. Among our ranks are members from vastly different walks of life and skill sets. We extend a hearty welcome to anyone, regardless of their chosen career path; from artists to businesspeople to musicians to programmers.
