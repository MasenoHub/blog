We, as Maseno Hub, are excited to announce our new blog, console.log(). We intend to keep a regular record of the society's events as well as miscellaneous related stuff.

We invite any interested party to apply to write for this blog. No special skills are required. All blog posts will be reviewed by another team member before publishing, therefore a good grasp of the English language is not necessary.

Posts are written in HTML or Markdown, and as such this knowledge is helpful. However, we are also working on a graphical editor to complement this blog. In the meantime, any interested individual can reach out to one of the team members for basic instruction in one of the two markup languages.

## Who Are We? What Do We Do?

Maseno Hub is a community aimed at bringing together like-minded individuals interested in technology as a whole, specifically within the greater Maseno area.

We heartily welcome all interested individuals to participate, regardless of race, gender, skill, et cetera. Our society comprises, aside from developers of various skill types and levels, non-programmers such as UI/UX Designers and even artists.

Worth mentioning is that we regularly plan for and hold various tech=oriented events, including but not limited to:

* Regular meetups.
* Tech seminars/talks.
* Study jams.

Plans are underway for our first ever hackathon, and from there we are planning on holding regular competitions in development, design and a multitude of other fields.

As a side note, if you would like to write for this blog, do get in touch with us via the contact form.
